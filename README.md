# Investigate a Dataset Medical Appointment No Shows 


In this project we will analyze dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and investigate a no-show medical appointments to find out which variables impact on the no-show.

Patient attributes in this analysis divide into :

Dependent Variable :

1.(No-show) that depends on other variables.

Independent Variables :

1. Scheduled Day.
2. Appointment Day.
3. Neighbourhood.
4. SMS_received.

## Questions:

- How early schedule has help patients showing up .
- Do neighborhoods have an impact on patients attending . 
- How SMS Appointment Reminder affect on No-Show .


## Conclusions

For the first question ,The line chart shows that early schedule has help patients for showing up. When the period between the scheduled day and appointment day increased, the no-show with decreased with high fluctuation until the period reached around 50 days then continue steadily. 

The neighborhoods chart didn't show any impact on patients attendance, the highest number of patients on Jardim Camburi district symmetric with the highest number of no-show patients on same district. 

The number of show up for patients didn't receive SMS grater than who received SMS. That's mean the SMS appointment reminder system had no effect in reducing the number of no-show.

## Limitations:

 - The data set includes mistakes data like age with negtive value and appointment day before scheduled day.

 - Adding distances between the neighborhoods and the hospitable to the dataset may give good results on 
   the neighborhood's impact .
